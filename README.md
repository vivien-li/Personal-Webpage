This is my first time creating a personal portfolio webpage and I'm proud to announce that it is now live at: https://vivienli.com/

# What I Learned
Over the course of the project, I was surprised at how powerful CSS was. Up until this point, I've only done minimal work in HTMl and CSS, and never took the time to 'beautify' a webpage. If I could go back, I wish I planned the layout of the webpage more before jumping straight in. I had to go back and modify a lot of the images, styles, and formatting of the webpage which took a decent amount of time. Overall, this was an extremely rewarding experience and I'm glad I got to dive deep into HTML and CSS and even used JavaScript for some animations on the webpage. I would also like to say that this webpage is mobile-friendly!
